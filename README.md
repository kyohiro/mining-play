#mining play 
mining play is designed to be yet another replacement for my favorite `Google Reader`. Over the years, I tried some replacements but none of them is full replacement of `Google Reader`. One key function I love so much is `share` feeds among friends, some other functions like `reading statistics` are also my target.

client side implementation was based on Matt's GoRead. Thanks a lot to Matt for similar ideas to reader.
different part is that we choose scala as server side implementation choice, this is the coolest language we think at the moment.
